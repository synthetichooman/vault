# Project Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of this static website project. The goal is to provide enough context for an AI assistant to understand the structure and build process.

## Overview

This project is a static portfolio website. It is built using a Python script (`build.py`) that generates HTML pages from content stored in the `archive` directory.

## Directory Structure

-   **`/` (Root)**
    -   `build.py`: The main Python script that builds the entire static site. It reads from `/archive`, generates HTML pages for each product, creates an `index.html` with a grid of all products, and copies static assets into the `/public` directory.
    -   `archive/`: This directory contains the raw content for the website, organized by brand, designer, and product.
        -   `archive/[brand]/[designer]/[product]/`: Each product has its own folder.
            -   `info.txt`: A text file containing metadata for the product, such as `era`, `status`, `category`, `price`, and `type`.
            -   `*.webp`: Product images in WebP format.
    -   `public/`: This is the output directory where the generated static website is placed. This directory is the one that should be deployed. It is generated by `build.py` and can be deleted and recreated.
    -   `css/`: Contains the CSS stylesheets for the website.
    -   `js/`: Intended for JavaScript files, though it may be empty if all JS is inlined in the HTML by the build script.
    -   `index.html`, `article.html`, `contact.html`: These appear to be old template files or remnants from a previous version. The primary build process is handled by `build.py`, which generates a new `index.html` and individual article pages in the `public/` directory.
    -   `protocol.md`: A file for logging project history and context for AI assistants.
    -   `CNAME`: Used by GitHub Pages to configure a custom domain.
    -   `favicon.ico`: The site's favicon.
    -   `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Build Process

1.  Run the `build.py` script (e.g., `python build.py`).
2.  The script cleans the `/public` directory.
3.  It traverses the `/archive` directory to find all products.
4.  For each product, it reads the `info.txt` metadata and finds all associated images.
5.  It generates an individual HTML page for each product.
6.  It generates a main `index.html` page that displays all products in a filterable grid.
7.  It copies the contents of `/css`, `/js`, and `/archive` (for images) into the `/public` directory.
8.  It copies `CNAME` and `favicon.ico` to the `/public` directory.
9.  The final, deployable website is located in the `/public` directory.

## Key Data Structures

-   **`info.txt` file:** A key-value store for product metadata. Each line is a `key: value` pair. Important keys include:
    -   `era`: The time period of the product.
    -   `status`: The availability status (e.g., `for sale`, `sold`, `not for sale`).
    -   `category`: The product category (e.g., `top`, `jacket`, `bottom`).
    -   `price`: The price of the item, formatted as `KRW/USD`.
    -   `type`: The classification of the item, either `vault` or `shop`.
